# Codesphere

Codesphere is a Q&A website made with Django and web technologies. It is the first version and an abandoned version of the Codesphere.org website. Most of this website was made by [@Anvay](https://github.com/megagames-me) and [@Alan](https://github.com/AlanLikesCoding). If you would like to use this website for personal purposes, you **must** disclose your source(this repository).

## Installation

Currently, there isn't a simple way to install this website, so unfortunately, you will have to `git clone` it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlanLikesCoding/Stor-io.git
```

## Usage

In order to use this website, you need the `django` dependency as well as the `pillow` dependencies. Then, simply run `python manage.py runserver` to run the server.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. As of right now, please use the SemVer versioning scheme and put your changes in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) file.

If we have enough contributions to this uncomplete website, we might decide to bring it back online.
