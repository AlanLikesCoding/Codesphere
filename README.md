# Codesphere

Codesphere is a python application that you can use to communicate with the coding community, inspired by other big forum websites such as StackOverflow and Quora.

With the Codesphere webapp, you can ask a question, and get many answers from our community of coders. You can also join the community in our quest to answer questions and ask meaningful ones as well. This is a friendly community for coders of all levels. 

The techonologies we used are Django, and basic web developement(HTML, CSS, JS).

Some ffeatures we hope to implement in the future include CMS on our admin platform, making a tutorial site, frameworks, and much more interesting projects.
